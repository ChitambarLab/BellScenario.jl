# BellScenario.jl

*Compute Bell inequalities and their quantum violations.*

## Features
  1. Provides types and constructors for describing Bell scenarios.
  2. Computes the local polytope which bounds classical Bell Scenarios.
  3. optimizes quantum states and measurements for quantum violation.


# Overview


## Bell Non-locality

Consider a black-box which contains some unknown physical system. The black-box
has a discrete input `x` and output `y` and its behavior is characterized by
the conditional probabilities `p(y|x)`. The statistics of the black-box provide
some insight into the workings of the physical system inside the black-box.
