# BellScenario.jl

*Compute Bell inequalities and their quantum violations.*

This software is a general tool for analyzing quantum non-locality in Bell scenarios.

## Features
  1. [`BellScenario`](@ref): Types and constructors for describing Bell scenarios.
  2. [`LocalPolytope`](@ref): Computes the bounds classical Bell Scenarios.
  3. [`Nonlocality`](@ref): Optimizes quantum states and measurements for non-locality.

# Overview

A Bell scenario describes a black-box system characterized by its input-output
statistics. A black-box is a device that takes an input and produces an output, however,
no other assumptions are made about the physical process inside the device.

When classical physics are applied within a black-box system, the resulting statistics
can be achieved using deterministic devices and randomness.
The statistics form a convex polytope which regarded as the *local polytope*.

Non-locality is a characteristic of quantum theory that allows strong correlations
to be made between distant black-boxes without any communication.
Classical devices are unable to replicate the statistic of quantum non-locality
which leads to advantages in communications, data processing, and information security.
