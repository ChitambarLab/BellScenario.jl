# BellComm.jl

*Compute Bell inequalities and their quantum violations.*

`BellComm.jl` performs two tasks:
  1. Computes the local polytope for classical bipartite Bell Scenarios enhanced with classical communication.
  2. Optimizes quantum states and measurements to find maximal quantum violations of the local bounds.
